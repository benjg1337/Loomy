Please note that the full text of the GPLv2 license is quite long and I've only included the beginning here. You should include the full text in your LICENSE.md file. You can find the full text of the GPLv2 license here.

At the end of the license, you should include a statement that specifies the year and the name of the copyright holders. For example:

`markdown
Loomy.sh is Copyright (C) [year] [fullname]

Loomy.sh is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation, either version 2 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version.
`

Replace [year] with the current year and [fullname] with your full name or the name of the copyright holder.
