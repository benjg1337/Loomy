Loomy(Ver 1.2.1)  User Manual  

NAME
  Loomy (Ver 1.2.1)
  
SYNOPSIS
  Unix & GNU/Linux IR tool that illuminates the way for weary cyber security analysts.
  
DESCRIPTION
  Loomy is the ideal tool for scraping through the complexities of a Unix file system with ease. Ideal for post security alert IR, generic 
  troubleshooting or for learning purposes.
  
  This tool aims to streamline the way we interact with the core utilites within the Unix file strucutre, as well as logging functions such as 
  journalctl, dot files, authentication logs and permissions to create a cohesive idea of what is occuring on a Unix derived based endpoint or 
  server.
  
  In essence this aims to be a swiss army knife of useful scripts to really drill down into what is happening within the operating system, for those 
  less confident within the command line.
